# Machine-_learning 
Till now, we have learned the basics of Machine Learning and some fundamental models.
We explored different types of learning methods, how to train a model with suitable data, and how to scale features to improve accuracy and reduce training time.
We also studied various cost functions that measure the error in predictions. 
Additionally, we learned an algorithm to minimize this cost function using gradient descent.
Specifically, we have studied two algorithms and their terminologies: Linear Regression and Logistic Regression.
