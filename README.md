# Machine-_learning 
Till now we have learnt basics of Machine learning and some basic models of it.
What are different tyes of Learing methods.
How to train model with suitable data.And scale features to incresae accuracy and traning time.
We learnt differnt cost functions that can measure error in predictions.
We learn algoritm to minimize this cost funcion using gradient descent functions.
Specificly we hve learn two algoritms and their terminologies .
Linear regression and logistic regression.
